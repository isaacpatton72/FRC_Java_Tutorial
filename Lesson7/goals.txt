talk about methods as behaviors and how it compliments attribtues
explain how to define a method
explain how it can change the state of something within a box
talk about how it is packaged into each of the boxes with all
    the other attributes.
reiterate how what happens in one box doesn't affect the other boxes
compare it agaisnt the constructor (requires an object,
    it is part of the box rather than the thing that defines
    how to build the box)
explain how they let us change the state of an objects, also
    known as the attributes so that our object can change 
    in real time whenever we want



Explain how methods are also extremely powerful for code reusability
How methods can define large behaviors to simplify complicated tasks
    into a single method
