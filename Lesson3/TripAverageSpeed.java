     * Problem Statement:
        You went on a trip that was divided into two parts. In the first part, you traveled 60 miles at a certain speed. 
        In the second part, which was also 60 miles, you traveled 20% faster than the first part. Calculate the overall 
        average speed.

        Logical Steps:
        Calculate the speed for the second part of the trip, knowing it's 20% faster than the first part.
        Calculate the time taken for each part of the trip using the speed and distance (Time = Distance / Speed).
        Calculate the total time for the trip by adding the time for both parts.
        Calculate the overall average speed using the total distance and total time (Speed = Total Distance / Total Time).
