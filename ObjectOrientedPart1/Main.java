    java will automatically look for this method and can actually find it any of the 
    files even if they are not named main. But the reason we name it main is so that 
    other programmers can easily find the starting point of the program. That is something
    you will quicky learn is very important. The vast majority of the things that you will
    be doing will be for the sake of other programmers. Its really easy to write code that 
    works but it is much harder to write code that is easy to read and understand for other 
    people.


    also know that there the vast majority of the time, only be one main method in a program.
    The only reason that I can have multiple main methods in this program being able to choose
    which one to run is because I set something up in VsCode to allow me to do that. This is not
    you will generally see in the real world. We will talk more about folder structure and orgranization
    later on but for now just remember that you will only have one main method in a program.
