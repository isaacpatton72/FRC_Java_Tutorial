     * the last lesson started digging into theese ideas of attributes and wrapping
     * up all this information into these boxes that we call objects. But the problem 
     * with our current setup is that the only thing that we currently have is a container
     * for storing all our information in one place. This is great and all but we can do 
     * so much more with these boxes.
     * 
     * remembering that we are learning about object oriented programming, and that we learned
     * how attributes describe the properties of an object, how do we describe something like
     * behavior? If our house should be able to turn on the air conditioning, how do we describe
     * that process? Our house can have an attribute that describes whether or not we have air 
     * conditioning, or whether or not the air conditioning is on, but how do we actually turn
     * it on? This is where a thing called methods come into play.
