         * this section explains the different data types in Java and
         * how to properly declare them. Also talks about the print function
         * and how you don't need to understand the syntax for now but that
         * you are able to put any variable in it to see it printed to the terminal
         * 
         * also talk about how variable declaration works and how you need to specify
         * the type name first and then the variable name which you are allowed to name
         * literally anything you want. Any time you use that name in the future you will
         * be calling that same variable you created earlier, the only thing is that they 
         * just have to be the same name that was created earlier.
