     * Do you really want to write out all these variable names for all maybe one thousand
     * houses in a neighboord hood? Going through and writing out all the variable names for
     * each house would be a nightmare. Having to write out roofColorHouse399 and counting would
     * actually take forever. But instead by using the blueprint on lines 4-6, we dont have to 
     * write out all the variable names for each house. We can just create a new house object
     * using somthing called a constructor which we will talk about in the next lesson.
