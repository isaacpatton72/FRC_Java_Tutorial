     * This topic of the entire series is probably the most important one that
     * you will learn in these tutorials and is the reason that I am teaching this 
     * topic so early compared to some other tutorials. The entire goal of java 
     * portion of this series is to teach you how to think in terms of objects, 
     * not in terms of code. With the release of tools like chat gpt it becomes
     * less and less important to remember the sytanx (all the words and symbols
     * that make up the code) and more important to understand the concepts behind
     * them because once you get over the initial learning curve of how coding works,
     * the vast majority of coding will become learning how organize code in a way
     * that will work not only right now, but also in the future when you have to add
     * things on top of it. 
     * 
     * 
     * Knowing that organization is the key to coding, I am going to explain the most 
     * important topic in programming, at least in my opinion in the context of robotics. 
     * The word to remember is OOP or Object Oriented Programming. This is the idea that
     * any idea that you have in your head can be broken down into objects that can be 
     * described with characteristics and verbs. Without Object Oriented Programming, it 
     * would be extremely difficult to come up with a way to represent the real world in 
     * code, which is even more strongly emphasized in robotics. You literally have these
     * physical pieces of hardware and you need to come up with a way to represent then in
     * this digitial world. The power of OOP is that it gives you a way to go from a couple 
     * of Integers and maybe formulas and provides you with an easy way of putting the puzzle 
     * pieces together to get a working robot or wheatever you are designing. 
     * 
     * 
     * The first step to learning about objects is through the idea of a class. A class represents 
     * everything that an object is. It is the blueprint for the object. The recipe to cook up your 
     * dish. The class in many cases is the entire file and contains may different parts but each one
     * ultimately describes the object that you are trying to create in some way. The first and simplest
     * part of the class is the attributes, or characteristics portion that describe all the variables
     * that can be used to help describe what a class is.
