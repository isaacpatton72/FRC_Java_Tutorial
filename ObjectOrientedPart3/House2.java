    * The first thing that we can do is give definitions to the attributes.

    * This is different from declaring a variable because when you declare a
    * variable, you are just saying that it exists but doesn't neccesarily store a 
    * value. When you initialize a variable, you are giving it a concrete value. 
    * Note that you will have to comment out the empty constructor up above
    * in order to make java happy. I will explain why in a moment.
