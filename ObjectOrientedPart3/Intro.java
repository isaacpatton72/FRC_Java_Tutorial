     * in this section we are going to be talking about constructors. 
     * continuing the example from the last section with the house 
     * analogy, the constructor can be thought of as a construction company.
     * They take in the blue print or building plans for a specific house,
     * assemble all of the pieces like the roof color, windows, and walls, 
     * and create one final house that is ready to be lived in and used. 
     * 
     * 
     * Another word you can use to describe a constructor is that it is the selector.
     * It selects which blueprint that you want to use and then creates the object.
     * In my mind I like to imagine that there are a bunch of different options that 
     * you can swipe through and what the constructor does is it forces you to choose
     * a specific combination of attributes that you want to describe the object you 
     * want to create. Then the constructor takes those attributes and creates your 
     * specific object that you can now interact with. 
     * 
     * lets look at an example of how to set up a constructor.
