     * up above is the syntax for creating a constructor. All that is 
     * requried is that you have the same name as the class and then
     * a pair of parentheses. This is the most basic constructor that
     * you can create. Now this constructor doesn't really do anything
     * for us at the moment but java gives us some cool tools to modify 
     * this to make it much much more useful.
